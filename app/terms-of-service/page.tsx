            <h2>eSIM Services</h2>
            <p>
              Our Service provides a platform for purchasing and managing eSIM profiles from various telecommunication
              providers in Myanmar. The availability, quality, and specific terms of the eSIM services (data allowances,
              validity, coverage, etc.) are determined by the respective telecom providers. We facilitate the delivery
              of the eSIM profile (e.g., via QR code) and provide support for the activation process on compatible
              devices. You are responsible for ensuring your device is eSIM compatible and network unlocked before
              purchase. Compatibility information is provided on our website but should be verified with your device
              manufacturer.
            </p>
            <h2>Accounts</h2>

              When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and
              current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate
              termination of your account on our Service. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use
              to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password.

              asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your payment
              information. All payments are processed through secure third-party payment gateways (e.g., MyanmarPay). We
              do not store your full payment card details. Prices for our products are subject to change without notice.
            </p>

              be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without
              limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your
